## Requirements

AngularJS is the only dependency.  All animations are CSS-based.

## Installation

You can install using Bower.

  bower install angular-feedback --save

Or, you can also download source files straight from this repo, they're located in the `dist` dir.
Just include the minified version of both `.js` and `.css` files.
